              consideration that there is an intellect which is pure and perfect
              actuality, such as the intellect of God, and it <seg

              participation in those <seg ana="#species">species</seg>, and he
              does this in the following way: Since our intellect <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knows</seg> an object by its <seg
              ana="#species">species</seg>, it is able to revert on its own
              activity, and from the activity it can proceed to its power, and
              from the power to the <seg ana="#essentia">essence</seg>, and thus
              by being actualized by another species it can <seg
              ana="#intelligere">know</seg> its own activity, and by the
              activity <supplied>it can know</supplied> itself. Hence that which
              is first known by a part of the intellect is its actuality, which
              is its final perfection. <seg ana="#quia">Since</seg> <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg> is not an activity that has an
              effect outside itself, such as cooling and building, but rather
              remains in the operating subject, therefore <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg> is not a perfection of some
              external thing like it is the case with building, but is the
              perfection of the intellect itself.

            another way in the universal, such as when it investigates its own

            species that is in the stone or in a material thing outside the

            To the third argument it must be said that the intellect of the

            in potentiality as possible, and the agent intellect itself, insofar

              To the final argument it must be said that it knows itself both by
              a species and by an activity, but not by its own species, which
              the argument proves, but by a species which belongs to something
              else. Similarly it <seg ana="#intelligere">knows</seg> itself by
              its own activity, and it knows that activity by still another
              activity. Therefore it must be understood that there is an
              intellect which is its own <seg ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg>,
              and therefore it knows its own essence and own knowing by a
              unitary activity, <seg ana="#quia">since</seg> they are the same,
              as the intellect of God. And there is another intellect which is
              not its own knowing, but by its essence it is object of its own
              knowing, such as the intellect of an intelligence, and although
              its knowing and its essence differ, it still knows its own essence
              and own knowing by a unitary act, since knowing is the perfection
              of its essence, and a thing and its perfection are known by a
              unitary act. But the human intellect is neither its own knowing
              nor is its essence object of its own knowing, and therefore it
              cannot know the object and its own knowing by a unitary act,
              because its knowing is not the perfection of its object. For
              knowing the stone is not the perfection of the stone, but it is
              the perfection of the intellect, and therefore it is not possible
              to know the stone and the knowing itself by a unitary act. Hence
              by this it must be said to the argument that it knows its own
              activity and its object by a different activity, and it knows that
              activity in actuality, and thus infinitely, and it is not
              inconvenient to proceed infinitely in activities of the intellect
              and reason.

              To the second proof it must be said that a sense senses by an
              alteration of a corporeal organ, and nothing corporeal alters
              itself, and therefore the sense is not altered except by something
              external. But the intellect is not altered by the alteration of
              the corporeal organ, but spiritually, and something spiritual can
              easily turn itself on itself, and therefore Plato said that the
              first mover moves itself, since the first mover could be soul and
              its activities, just as to love and cherish, and in this way it
              could be its movement.
