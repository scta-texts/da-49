              its participation in those <seg ana="#species">species</seg>, and
              he does this in the following way: Since our intellect <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knows</seg> an object through its <seg
              ana="#species">species</seg>, it is able to revert on its own
              activity, and from the activity it can proceed to its power, and
              from the power to the <seg ana="#essentia">essence</seg>, and thus
              by being actualized by another species it can <seg
              ana="#intelligere">know</seg> its own activity, and by the
              activity <supplied>it can know</supplied> itself. Hence what is
              first known as concerns the intellect is its actuality, which is
              its final perfection. <seg ana="#quia">Since</seg> <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg> is not an activity that has an
              effect outside itself, such as heating and building, but rather
              remains in the operating subject, therefore <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg> is not a perfection of some
              external thing as is building, but is the perfection of the
              intellect itself.

            But this activity it can understand in two ways. In one way in the
            particular, such as when it perceives that it is itself actually
            <seg ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg>, and in another way in the
            universal, such as when it investigates its own particular function
            through its object. And in the same way it can <seg

            actuality, and in another way as a universal, such as when it
            inquires about the nature of the intellect through its function. And
            these ways differ, <seg ana="#quia">since</seg> the presence of the
            intellect that is actualized in an activity suffices for the first
            <seg ana="#cognitio">cognition</seg>, but for the second <seg
            ana="#cognitio">cognition</seg> a subtle and distinguishing
            inquisition is required, and for this reason many have been ignorant

            immediate principle of knowing. Hence whatever has in it an actually
            intelligible species, can know, but whichever species is in the
            stone or in a material thing outside the intellect is only
            intelligible in potency, and therefore no intelligible thing outside
            our intellect has its immediate principle of knowing in itself, and
            for that reason cannot know. But a species which is in the intellect

            species of that which is known in actuality is the realizing form
            which informs the intellect, and through this form the intellect
            knows itself discursively and not through its essence.

            To the third argument it must be said that the intellect of an

            For in itself is has connate species. But by itself our intellect is
            in potentiality, i.e. a “possible” <supplied>intellect</supplied>,
            and the agent intellect itself, insofar as it is actualized, is the

            To the fourth it must be said that the act of knowing is caused by

            more united with the intellect than it is with itself, it still
            cannot be united with itself as an object, because the object of our

            that cannot be united with the intellect except through a species.

              To the final argument it must be said that it knows itself both
              through a species and through an activity, but not through its own
              species, as the argument proves, but through a species which
              belongs to something else. Similarly it <seg
              ana="#intelligere">knows</seg> itself through its own activity,
              and it knows that activity through still another activity.
              Therefore it must be understood that there is an intellect which
              is its own <seg ana="#intelligere">knowing</seg>, and therefore it
              knows its own essence and own knowing through a unitary activity,
              <seg ana="#quia">because</seg> they are the same, namely the
              intellect of God. And there is another intellect which is not its
              own knowing, but through its essence is an object of its own
              knowing, namely the intellect of an intelligence, and although its
              knowing and its essence differ, it still knows its own essence and
              own knowing through a unitary act, since knowing is the perfection
              of its essence, and a thing and its perfection are known through a
              unitary act. But the human intellect is neither its own knowing
              nor is its essence an object of its own knowing, and therefore it
              cannot know the object and its own knowing through a unitary act,
              because its knowing is not the perfection of its object. For
              knowing the stone is not the perfection of the stone, but it is
              the perfection of the intellect, and therefore it is not possible
              to know the stone and the knowing itself through a unitary act.
              Hence by this it must be said to the argument that it knows its
              own activity and its object through a different activity, and it
              knows that activity by an act, and thus ad infinitum, and it is
              not inconvenient to proceed ad infinitum in activities of the
              intellect and reason.

              To the second proof it must be said that a sense senses by an
              alteration of a corporeal organ, and nothing corporeal alters
              itself, and therefore the sense is not altered except by something
              external. But the intellect is not altered by the alteration of
              the corporeal organ, but spiritually, and something spiritual is
              perfectly capable of turning itself on itself, and therefore Plato
              said that the first mover moves itself, because he held that the
              first mover is the soul, and held that its functions -- liking,
              rejoycing etc. -- are its movement.
