            a <seg ana="#cognitio">knowledge</seg> about that to which they
            belong. But now many accidents that belong to the soul itself are
            <seg ana="#manifestus">obvious</seg> to us: For <seg

            To the next argument it must be said that <seg

            the act of something imperfect, as it is defined by the <name

            <cit>

            , and in another way it is the act of something perfect, and in this
            way <seg ana="#intelligere">intellection</seg> and <seg
            ana="#sentire">cognition</seg> are said to be movements. In the
            first way the same thing cannot be moving and moved by itself, but
            accidentally nothing prevents this, just as the sailor moves the
            ship by himself, and insofar as the ship is moved he moves
            himself. In the second way nothing prevents the same thing from
            moving itself. There is however a difference: For there is one sort
            of substance which always actively <seg
            ana="#intelligere_ptc">knows</seg>, and such a substance can <seg
            ana="#intelligere">know</seg> by itself, as it is the case with the
            first cause and the intelligences; but there is another sort of
            substance, such as the human soul, which does not always actively
            <seg ana="#intelligere_ptc">know</seg>, and such a thing does not
            <seg ana="#intelligere">know</seg> by itself, <seg
            ana="#quia">since</seg> it <seg ana="#intelligere">knows</seg>
            nothing except when it is actualized, and such a substance, <seg
            ana="#cum+subj">since</seg> it potentially <seg
            ana="#intelligere_ptc">knows</seg>, does not actually do so except
            by means of something else, that is by means of an intelligible <seg
            ana="#species">species</seg>, and <seg ana="#ideo">therefore</seg>
            it can <seg ana="#intelligere">know</seg> itself through something
            else. For by the fact that the soul <seg
            ana="#intelligere">knows</seg> an object by a <seg
            ana="#species">species</seg> it can <seg
            ana="#intelligere">know</seg> its own activity, and by the activity
            it can <seg ana="#reflectere">reflect</seg> itself on its own <seg
