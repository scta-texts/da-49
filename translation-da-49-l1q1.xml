            <seg ana="#intelligere">intellection</seg> and <seg

            way the same thing cannot be moving and moved by itself, but
            accidentally nothing prevents it, just as the sailor moves the ship
            by himself, and in that being moved he moves himself. In the other
            way nothing prevents the same thing from moving itself. But there is
            although a difference: For there is one sort of substance which
            always actively <seg ana="#intelligere_ptc">knows</seg>, and such a
            substance can <seg ana="#intelligere">know</seg> by itself, just as

            is another sort of substance which does not always actively <seg

            a thing does not <seg ana="#intelligere">know</seg> by itself, <seg

            nothing except when it is actualized, and such a substance, <seg

            it can <seg ana="#intelligere">know</seg> itself through something
            else. For by the fact that the soul <seg
